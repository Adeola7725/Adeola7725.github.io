        <h1>Rules of Mancala:</h1>
        <h2>The Board:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the board for the Mancala game consists of two rows of 6 pits, one row per player, and two Mancalas, or scoring pools, one for each player</li>
            <li>the two rows of pits are represented by the buttons, with the numbers showing how many marbles are in each pit</li>
            <li>the bottom row is the first player's pits, and the top row is the second player's pits</li>
            <li>the two scoring pools are on the sides, the right side is the first player's pool, and the left side is the second player's pool</li>
            <li>all the pits start with four marbles, and the scoring pools start with zero points</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Game:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>at the start of each turn, the player will pick one of their pits to seed</li>
            <li>the marbles in the pit will be seeded in a counterclockwise direction across the board, with one marble being seeded into each following pit</li>
            <li>any marbles that are seeded into the player's scoring pool will stay there for the rest of the game</li>
            <li>the game ends when there are no marbles left on a player's side, and at that point the other player will get all the remaining marbles inside their pits</li>
            <li>the player with the most marbles in their scoring pool at the end wins the game</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Special Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player's last marble lands in their scoring pool, they get another turn</li>
            <li>If a player's last marble lands in a previously empty pit on their side, they get the marble from that pit and any marbles in the pit directly opposite</li>
        </ul>
